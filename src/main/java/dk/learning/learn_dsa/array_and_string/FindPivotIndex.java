 * @note Question
 *     <p>Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array. The pivot index
 *     is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to
 *     the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
 *     <p>If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no
 *     elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array. Return the leftmost
 *     pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
