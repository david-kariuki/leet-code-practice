 * @question Can Place Flowers
 *     <p>You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not.
 *     However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 *     <p>Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means
 *     not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed
 *     without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.
 * @example Example 1: Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1 Output: true
 * @example Example 2: Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2 Output: false
 * @constraints 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104 flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1. There are no two adjacent
 *     flowers in flowerbed. 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
 * @since 20/07/23
